2. Creating SNOW Tickets
2.1 Common Challenges
2.1.1 Incomplete Information
Users might encounter issues when they do not provide sufficient information about their problems, making it challenging for the SRE team to understand and address the issue effectively.

2.1.2 Incorrect Categorization
Misclassifying the issue may lead to delays in resolution, as the ticket might be routed to the wrong team or department.

2.1.3 Lack of Urgency
Failing to indicate the severity or urgency of the issue can result in slower response times, especially for critical problems.

2.2 Solutions
2.2.1 Provide Detailed Information
To overcome incomplete information issues:

Encourage users to provide a clear and concise description of the problem.
Request users to include steps to reproduce the issue and relevant system details.
2.2.2 Select the Correct Category
To avoid incorrect categorization:

Ensure users choose the appropriate category or service catalog item when creating the SNOW ticket.
2.2.3 Set Priority
To address the lack of urgency:

Encourage users to set the priority level based on the impact and urgency of the issue.
3. Production Issues
3.1 Common Challenges
3.1.1 Unclear Symptoms
Common issues related to production problems include:

Users may not be able to describe the issue accurately, leading to misdiagnosis.
3.1.2 Insufficient Logs
Lack of relevant logs or information can hinder troubleshooting.
3.1.3 Unplanned Downtime
Production issues may result in unexpected downtime or service disruptions.
3.2 Solutions
3.2.1 Detailed Problem Description
To address unclear symptoms:

Ask users to provide a detailed account of the issue, including error messages and affected components.
3.2.2 Log Collection
To address insufficient logs:

Encourage users to gather relevant logs and attach them to the SNOW ticket.
3.2.3 Emergency Communication
To handle unplanned downtime:

Implement a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed during service disruptions.
4. Feed Status / Delays
4.1 Common Challenges
4.1.1 Lack of Visibility
Users may encounter issues due to the lack of real-time visibility into the status of data feeds.

4.1.2 Unexpected Delays
Delays in data processing can impact business operations and cause frustration among users.
